 #CC - Programming Language
   Hello programmers of GitHub my name will always be Mr.Lisivo. I from here on out, I am gonna focus on creating and commiting to this language wich is essentially embracing C but adding collision elements to it. To be able to compress, add random elements and/or new elements. The language will be "collision-based".
   Regarding updates on the development and/or theory behind such a language, all will be posted in GitHub in 2 years time. I am gonna see you then...
